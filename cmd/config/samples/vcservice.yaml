  retry: # The exponential backoff retry strategy for database operation.

    # initial-interval: Specifies the duration of the first backoff interval.
    # This is the time to wait before the first retry attempt.
    # Format: string representing a duration (e.g., "500ms", "1s", "2.5s").
    initial-interval: 500ms

    # randomization-factor: Controls the amount of randomness (jitter) applied to each backoff interval.
    # The actual backoff duration for an attempt will be randomly selected from the range:
    # [current_interval * (1 - randomization_factor), current_interval * (1 + randomization_factor)]
    # A factor of 0 means no randomization. A factor of 0.5 means the actual interval
    # can vary by +/- 50% of the calculated interval.
    # Must be between 0 and 1.
    randomization-factor: 0.5

    # multiplier: The factor by which the backoff interval increases after each failed attempt.
    # The next interval (before randomization) is calculated as: current_interval * multiplier.
    # A value of 1.5 means each subsequent interval will be 50% longer than the previous one.
    # Must be >= 1.
    multiplier: 1.5

    # max-interval: Sets the absolute maximum duration for any single backoff interval.
    # Even if the calculated interval (initial_interval * multiplier^n) exceeds this value,
    # the interval used (before randomization) will be capped at max-interval.
    # Format: string representing a duration (e.g., "60s", "1m", "5m").
    max-interval: 60s

    # max-elapsed-time: The maximum total time allowed for retries since the operation first began.
    # If the total time spent (including execution time of attempts and backoff waits)
    # exceeds this duration, the retry mechanism will stop, even if other limits haven't been reached.
    # Setting this to "0" means there is no time limit, and retries will continue
    # indefinitely until successful.
    # Format: string representing a duration (e.g., "15m", "1h").
    max-elapsed-time: 15m
