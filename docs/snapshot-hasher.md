## 1. Overview

The snapshot hasher turns a committed `_snapshot` record into a content hash of the
snapshot's clone database. It is the only component that hashes snapshots. It is named
for what it does, and deliberately not "snapshot service": it never creates a snapshot
or its clone — the validator-committer does that on the commit path.

It exposes no RPCs of its own. Work reaches it exclusively through the state
database: the validator-committer (VC) commits a `_snapshot` record together with its
clone, and this service discovers that record on a later poll. Its gRPC server exists
only so the service can be health-checked the same way as every other service.

Implementation: [service/snapshothasher](/service/snapshothasher). The durable record contract it
shares with the VC lives in
[utils/statedb/snapshot_state.go](/utils/statedb/snapshot_state.go), next to the schema
it reads.

## 2. Why a Separate Service

Hashing a snapshot is a full scan of every hashed table in a clone. It is neither part
of committing a transaction nor something that several processes should attempt at
once, so it is deployed as **one instance** alongside any number of VCs.

That single-instance deployment is what keeps the design simple. With exactly one
scheduler in the system, and hashing running inline on its polling goroutine, one
snapshot is hashed at a time and no cross-process exclusion is needed — no lease, no
ownership token, no leader election. Running a second instance is a deployment error;
because a clone is immutable and the digest is deterministic, the symptom is duplicate
work writing the same digest, not a corrupted record.

The VC's only snapshot duty is therefore to make the record durable atomically with
its clone. See [Creating State Snapshots](validator-committer.md#task-4-creating-state-snapshots-clone-first).

## 3. Scheduling Model

The hasher polls the latest `_snapshot` record every `poll-interval` and hashes it
whenever it still needs hashing. Nothing notifies it, so:

- hashing begins within one interval of the snapshot committing;
- after a restart, the first check happens one interval in;
- one path covers a fresh snapshot, one the coordinator resubmitted, and one orphaned
  mid-hash by a restart — they differ only in the status the tick reads.

Hashing runs inline, so a job that outlives the interval delays the next check rather
than starting a second hash.

The latest-snapshot pointer in the `metadata` table is what makes discovery a single
key lookup instead of a scan of the growing `ns__snapshot` table. The VC writes that
pointer in the same transaction as the record it names, so the pointer never names a
row that did not commit.

## 4. Snapshot Record Lifecycle

| Status read by a tick | Action |
|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Hash it: this is a snapshot the VC just committed |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Hash it: the only way this is seen is a job orphaned by a restart |
| `FAILED` | Hash it again: a clone is immutable, so a retry cannot produce a different digest |
| `COMPLETED` | Leave untouched — the digest is already published |
| `CHECKPOINTED` | Leave untouched — re-hashing could only undo the checkpoint |

Two conditions stop the service instead of being retried:

- **A committed record whose clone is not there to hash.** The clone is created before
  its snapshot transaction commits, so a committed record always names a clone that
  exists. Neither shape of absence — no `clone_database` recorded, or a recorded name
  whose database is gone — can be produced by this system, which leaves external
  interference or storage corruption. No retry repairs either, and recording a failed
  attempt on the record would invite a later tick to treat it as retryable work, so the
  service stops and leaves the record as evidence.
- **A record with no `TxRef`** is a hard error, because a record that cannot be named
  cannot be driven; treating it as "nothing to do" would stall hashing silently.

A missing clone database is reported on the first attempt rather than after the
database retry budget: `statedb.NewPool` treats SQLSTATE 3D000 (`invalid_catalog_name`)
as terminal, since a database that does not exist will not appear on a later attempt.

A failed hash records its cause on the record itself, so an operator sees why without
reading this hasher's log, and the next tick retries it.

## 5. Hash Computation

The digest is a SHA-256 over the clone's committed content, computed so that identical
clone content always yields an identical digest:

- The hashed set follows one rule: **hash what every organization's clone must agree
  on, and exclude what each organization derives locally.** It is every user
  namespace's `ns_<id>` table (from `ns__meta`, the authoritative namespace registry),
  plus the fixed tables `ns__config`, `ns__meta`, `tx_status`, and `ns__checkpoint`.
    - `ns__checkpoint` is included: a checkpoint is committed by an ordered, endorsed
      transaction, so it holds the same content at the same height everywhere. There is
      no cycle — the checkpoint for a snapshot commits only after that snapshot's digest
      exists, so it can appear in a later clone but never in its own.
    - `metadata` is excluded, and cannot be included: `last committed block number` is
      written by each sidecar on its own `last-committed-block-set-interval`, so two
      organizations holding byte-identical committed state still hold different values
      when a clone is taken.
    - `ns__snapshot` is excluded: it is this service's own hashing progress, written
      while the hash runs.

  Excluding those two costs nothing, because neither is state a node bootstrapped from a
  snapshot needs: `ns__snapshot` records one organization's hashing progress, and
  `metadata` is local bookkeeping the new node rebuilds as it runs. Where a value is
  genuinely needed — `last committed block number` — it can be set during bootstrap from
  the snapshot's own height rather than carried in the digest.
- Each table is scanned in primary-key order in bounded pages (keyset pagination), so
  worker memory stays bounded on large tables and the scan is served by the primary-key
  index with no sort step.
- Rows are folded in with length-prefixed encoding (`len(key)||key||len(value)||value`),
  which prevents boundary collisions between adjacent keys and values.
- Per-table digests are combined in a fixed order — `ns__config`, `ns__meta`,
  `tx_status`, `ns__checkpoint`, then user namespaces in `ns__meta` key order — so the
  result does not depend on which table finished first.

Only the combined root hash is persisted today. Localizing a divergence between
organizations — per-table digests, then a Merkle Patricia trie over a table's rows — is
planned work for this service and does not change this encoding. That work is still
hashing, only at a finer granularity, so it fits the service's name rather than
outgrowing it.

## 6. Configuration

Sample: [cmd/config/samples/snapshot-hasher.yaml](/cmd/config/samples/snapshot-hasher.yaml).

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `database` | — | State-database connection. `max-connections` sizes only the record poll (one statement at a time); each clone gets its own short-lived pool instead, sized from `max-workers-for-hash` |
| `poll-interval` | `1m` | How often the latest snapshot record is re-read; also the scheduling latency and the restart resume delay |
| `resource-limits.max-workers-for-hash` | `4` | Tables hashed in parallel within one job, and therefore the clone pool's connection count |
| `resource-limits.hash-batch-size` | `1000` | Rows fetched per round-trip while scanning a table |

Tuning guidance: [Performance Tuning — Snapshot Hasher](performance-tuning.md#8-snapshot-hasher).

Start it with:

```bash
./bin/committer start snapshot-hasher --config <config-file>
```

## 7. Failure and Recovery

The hasher holds no state of its own; the `_snapshot` record is the state.

- **Restart mid-hash.** The record is left `IN_PROGRESS` and the partial digest is
  discarded. The first tick after restart re-reads that record and hashes it from
  scratch. Because the clone is immutable, the recomputed digest is the same one the
  interrupted attempt would have produced.
- **Transient database or clone failure.** The tick logs the failure and records it on
  the record; the loop keeps running and the next tick retries. A failure never stops
  the service, because the durable record is still there to be picked up.
- **Hasher down entirely.** Ordinary transaction commit is unaffected — the VC never
  calls this service and never waits on it. Only snapshotting stalls: the outstanding
  record is not hashed, so it never reaches `CHECKPOINTED`, and the VC rejects further
  snapshot requests until the hasher returns and drives that record to `COMPLETED`. So
  at most one snapshot is outstanding while the hasher is down, not a backlog of them.
- **A record the hasher refuses to drive.** The service exits, so a supervisor's restart
  loop and the exit message are the signal. Because checkpointing proceeds only from a
  `COMPLETED` record, the snapshot stalls rather than being checkpointed without a
  digest, and the VC keeps rejecting new snapshots until the latest one is
  `CHECKPOINTED` — so this needs an operator, and the exit message names the record and
  the clone it could not hash.
- **A record taken over mid-hash.** A checkpoint transaction can commit for a slow
  organization while its hasher is still scanning, and a second hasher (a deployment
  error) can publish first. Every status write names the statuses it was decided
  against, so a job whose record has moved has its write rejected rather than applied —
  publishing a digest over a `CHECKPOINTED` record would undo the checkpoint. This is
  logged and left uncounted: the next tick re-reads the record and decides again from
  its new status.

### Observability

`snapshothasher_poll_errors_total` is the metric to alert on: it counts ticks that
could not determine whether there is work at all (state database unreachable, a
pointer that names no row, a record that does not decode). The hash-job counters
cannot express those — such a tick completes no job and fails none — so without it a
service whose database is down looks the same as an idle one.

`snapshothasher_hash_started_total` covers the opposite blind spot. Hashing a clone is
a full scan and can run for many minutes, but `snapshothasher_hash_duration_seconds` is
observed only once a scan returns, so a hash in flight would otherwise look like an idle
service. Counting starts separately makes it a gap against the terminal counters:

```promql
# A hash started and has neither computed a digest nor recorded a failure.
snapshothasher_hash_started_total
  - (snapshothasher_hash_duration_seconds_count + snapshothasher_hash_jobs_failed_total)
```

`jobs_failed_total` belongs in that sum because a failed hash never reaches the
histogram — the failure is recorded before the duration is observed — so comparing
starts against `duration_seconds_count` alone would report a permanent in-flight hash
after the first failure.

A value of 1 is a hash running normally; alert on a sustained difference, since that is
what separates a long scan from a stuck one. Two things this cannot do: a hash lost to a
killed process shows up only after the fact, from the stored series, because an
in-process counter resets to zero along with every other one and a fresh start therefore
looks idle; and elapsed time is inferred from how long the difference persists rather
than read directly, which is why the alert belongs in a rule's `for:` clause rather than
in the expression.

A second gap separates a digest that was computed from one that was published:

```promql
# A digest was computed but never published: the record was taken over mid-hash, or the
# COMPLETED write failed.
snapshothasher_hash_duration_seconds_count
  - (snapshothasher_hash_jobs_completed_total + snapshothasher_hash_jobs_failed_total)
```

This is the symptom of a second hasher running against the same state database, which is
a deployment error: both processes hash the same immutable clone, and the one that
publishes second has its write rejected. Nothing is corrupted — the digest is
deterministic — but the wasted work is otherwise visible only in the logs.

See [Metrics Reference](metrics_reference.md).

## 8. Known Limitations

- **No digest algorithm version is recorded.** Any future change to the hashed set or
  the encoding — for example the planned per-table digests and Merkle Patricia trie —
  would make an already-committed checkpoint unverifiable, because a re-ingesting node
  has no way to know which algorithm produced that digest. The version belongs in the
  checkpoint transaction payload, which is the artifact organizations agree on and the
  one re-ingestion reads; that payload is not defined yet.
- **Terminal abort handling is not here yet.** A `FAILED` record is always retried, so
  a snapshot that can never be hashed — a clone lost for good, say — has no terminal
  resting state. An `ABORTED` status and an abort snapshot transaction, which is what
  makes an abort reproducible under re-ingestion, are the immediate next change.
