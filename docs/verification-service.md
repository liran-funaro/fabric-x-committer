## 1. Overview

The Verification Service is a component in the Fabric-X Committer architecture responsible for validating transaction 
signatures against namespace policies.
It ensures that only properly authorized transactions are committed to the state database by verifying
signatures against the appropriate policies.

### Core Responsibilities

The Verification Service performs several key functions:

1. **Policy Management**: Maintains and updates signature verification policies for different namespaces.
2. **Signature Verification**: Validates transaction signatures against the appropriate namespace policies.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently processes verification requests using parallel execution.
4. **Batched Responses**: Optimizes performance by batching verification responses.

## 2. Architecture

### Components

The Verification Service consists of several key components:

1. **Server**: The main entry point that implements the gRPC `VerifierServer` interface.
It handles incoming verification requests and manages the verification streams.
2. **Verifier**: The core component responsible for signature verification.
It maintains a map of namespace policies and performs the actual signature validation.
3. **Parallel Executor**: Manages parallel processing of verification requests to optimize throughput.
It handles input distribution, verification execution, and output collection.
4. **Policy Manager**: Handles policy updates and parsing from configuration transactions and namespace policies.

### Workflow

The Verification Service operates with the following workflow:

1. **Stream Initialization**: Clients establish a bidirectional gRPC stream with the service.
2. **Request Processing**: The service receives batches of verification requests through the stream.
3. **Policy Updates**: If included in the request batch, policy updates are processed and applied.
4. **Parallel Verification**: Verification requests are distributed to worker goroutines for parallel processing.
5. **Response Batching**: Verification results are collected, batched, and sent back to the client.

## 3. Signature Verification

### Policy Management

The Verification Service maintains policies for different namespaces in an atomic map structure.
Policies can be updated through two mechanisms:

1. **Configuration Transactions**: System-wide policies are extracted from configuration transactions in the `config` namespace.
2. **Namespace Policies**: Individual namespace policies are managed through the `meta` namespace.

The service uses a lock-free design with an atomic pointer to update the policy map without blocking ongoing verifications.

For a detailed guide on namespace policy types (threshold rules and MSP rules), cached identities,
and policy lifecycle, see [Namespace Policy](namespace-policy.md). For internal verification mechanics
(signing input, identity resolution, policy propagation), see [§8](#8-namespace-policy-verification).

### Verification Process

The verification process follows these steps:

1. **Policy Lookup**: For each namespace in a transaction, the service looks up the corresponding policy.
2. **Signature Validation**: The service validates the transaction signatures against the namespace policy.
3. **Result Determination**: If all signatures are valid, the transaction is marked as `COMMITTED`.
   Otherwise, it's marked as `ABORTED_SIGNATURE_INVALID`.

## 4. Parallel Execution

### Execution Model

The Verification Service uses a parallel execution model to maximize throughput:

1. **Worker Pool**: The service maintains a pool of worker goroutines, with the size determined by the `parallelism` configuration.
2. **Channel-Based Communication**: Workers communicate through channels to distribute work and collect results.

The parallel execution flow is as follows:

1. **Input Distribution**: Incoming requests are distributed to worker goroutines through an input channel.
2. **Parallel Processing**: Each worker independently verifies its assigned transactions.
3. **Result Collection**: Verification results are collected through an output channel.
4. **Response Batching**: Results are batched before being sent back to the client.

### Batching Strategy

The service employs a batching strategy to optimize performance:

1. **Size-Based Batching**: Responses are batched until they reach a configurable size threshold (`BatchSizeCutoff`).
2. **Time-Based Batching**: If the size threshold isn't reached within a configurable time window (`BatchTimeCutoff`), the batch is sent anyway.
3. **Buffer Management**: The service maintains buffers for both input and output to handle load fluctuations.

## 5. Configuration

The Verification Service requires the following configuration settings, provided in a YAML [configuration file](/cmd/config/samples/verifier.yaml):

- **Server**: Network configuration for the gRPC server, including address and port.
- **Monitoring**: Configuration for the Prometheus metrics server.
- **Parallel Executor**:
  - `parallelism`: Number of worker goroutines for parallel processing.
  - `batch-size-cutoff`: Minimum number of responses to trigger a batch.
  - `batch-time-cutoff`: Maximum time to wait before sending a batch.
  - `channel-buffer-size`: Size of the channel buffers for handling load fluctuations.

## 6. Monitoring and Metrics

The Verification Service exposes several Prometheus metrics to monitor its performance:

1. **Transaction Throughput**:
   - `verifier_server_tx_in`: Counter for incoming transactions.
   - `verifier_server_tx_out`: Counter for outgoing verification results.

2. **Active Requests**:
   - `verifier_server_parallel_executor_active_requests`: Gauge for the number of active verification requests.

These metrics provide insights into the service's performance and can be used for capacity planning and troubleshooting.

## 7. Error Handling and Recovery

The Verification Service implements robust error handling to ensure reliable operation:

1. **Stream Error Handling**: The service gracefully handles stream errors by cleaning up resources.
2. **Policy Update Errors**: If a policy update fails, the service returns an error message and aborts the stream.
3. **Context Cancellation**: The service properly handles context cancellation to ensure clean shutdown.
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: When the service is shutting down, it allows in-flight operations to complete or time out.

## 8. Namespace Policy Verification

For usage documentation on namespace policy types (threshold rules, MSP rules), protobuf structures,
and examples, see [namespace-policy.md](namespace-policy.md). This section covers the internal
verification mechanics.

### Signing Input

The namespace data is first ASN.1 DER-encoded via `TxNamespace.ASN1Marshal(txID)` to produce a
deterministic byte sequence. Both policy types verify signatures over this data, but differ in
how hashing is applied:

- **Threshold rules**: The committer computes `SHA256` explicitly and calls `verifyDigest(digest, sig)`.
- **MSP rules**: The committer passes the raw ASN.1 bytes to the MSP's `identity.Verify(msg, sig)`,
  which internally computes `SHA256(msg)` before verification.

### Threshold Rule Verification

The verifier ASN.1-encodes the namespace data, computes `SHA256` of the result,
and verifies the signature against the configured public key. The `Identity` field in the
endorsement is ignored — only the `Endorsement` (signature bytes) is used, since the public key
is already embedded in the policy.

### MSP Rule Verification

When a transaction arrives at the Verification Service with an MSP rule namespace:

1. The verifier extracts the endorsements for the namespace from `tx.Endorsements[nsIndex]`.
2. Each endorsement's `Identity` field is deserialized through the MSP's `IdentityDeserializer`.
3. The deserialized identities are paired with their signatures to form `SignedData` entries.
4. The `SignaturePolicyEnvelope` rule tree is evaluated against the `SignedData` set.
5. If the policy is satisfied, the namespace verification succeeds.

**Important:** Signatures are consumed in order during evaluation. A single endorser cannot satisfy
two distinct principal requirements, even if their identity matches both. Each `SignedBy` leaf
consumes one signature from the set.

### Cached Identity Resolution

When the MSP initializes (or updates via a config block), it calls `setupKnownCerts()` which:

1. Parses each certificate from `known_certs`.
2. Computes `hex(SHA256(cert.Raw))` where `cert.Raw` is the DER-encoded certificate bytes (not PEM).
3. Stores the deserialized identity in a map keyed by `IdentityIdentifier{Mspid, Id}`.

```

When the Verification Service encounters a `certificate_id` in an endorsement's `Identity`,
the `ToSerializedIdentity()` utility resolves it by calling `GetKnownDeserializedIdentity()` on the MSP.
If the ID is not found in the known identities map, verification fails. If found, the full deserialized
identity is used for signature verification and policy evaluation.

When a new config block arrives, the MSP is re-initialized and `UpdateIdentities()` is called on
MSP-rule verifiers to refresh the identity deserializer with the latest known identity mappings.

### Policy Propagation

Policy updates flow through the system as follows:

```

1. The Sidecar receives a block containing a meta namespace transaction from the Ordering Service,
   validates its formation (block and transaction format checks), and forwards the transactions to the Coordinator.
   See [sidecar.md](sidecar.md) for the full block ingestion flow.
2. The Coordinator forwards the `_meta` transaction to the Validator-Committer for validation and commit.
3. The Validator-Committer validates and commits the `_meta` transaction to the state database,
   then returns `COMMITTED` status to the Coordinator.
4. **Only upon receiving `COMMITTED` status**, the Coordinator extracts policy items from the
   committed transaction's namespaces via `GetUpdatesFromNamespace()` and updates the local
   policy manager (`policyManager.updateFromTx()`).
5. The updated policies are wrapped in a `VerifierUpdates` message and piggybacked onto the
   next verification batch sent to the Verification Service.
6. The Verification Service parses the new policies, merges them with the existing policy map,
   and atomically swaps the pointer — no locks, no blocking of concurrent verifications.

**Ordering guarantee:** The Coordinator updates the policy manager **before** releasing dependent
transactions from the dependency graph. This ensures that data transactions targeting a newly
created namespace are not freed for signature verification until the correct policy is available
in the policy manager, which will be sent to the Verification Service with the next batch.

## 9. Implementation Details

### Core Components

The Verification Service is implemented in the `service/verifier` package with the following key components.

#### Server

The `Server` struct (under `verifier_server.go`) implements the gRPC server interface and stream handling.

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/verifier_server.go](/service/verifier/verifier_server.go).
```go
type Server struct {
    protosigverifierservice.UnimplementedVerifierServer
    ...
}
```

It provides the following methods:
- `New(config *Config) *Server`: Creates a new server instance.
- `Run(ctx context.Context) error`: Starts the server and monitoring.
- `WaitForReady(context.Context) bool`: Checks if the server is ready.
- `StartStream(stream protosigverifierservice.Verifier_StartStreamServer) error`: Handles verification streams.

#### Verifier

The `verifier` struct (under `verify.go`) contains the core verification logic.

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/verify.go](/service/verifier/verify.go).
```go
type verifier struct {
    verifiers atomic.Pointer[map[string]*signature.NsVerifier]
}
```

It provides the following methods:
- `newVerifier() *verifier`: Creates a new verifier instance.
- `updatePolicies(update *protosigverifierservice.Update) error`: Updates verification policies.
- `verifyRequest(request *protosigverifierservice.Request) *protosigverifierservice.Response`: Verifies a single request.

#### Parallel Executor

The `parallelExecutor` struct (under `parallel_executor.go`) manages parallel processing of verification requests.

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/parallel_executor.go](/service/verifier/parallel_executor.go).
```go
type parallelExecutor struct {
    inputCh        chan *protosigverifierservice.Request
    outputSingleCh chan *protosigverifierservice.Response
    outputCh       chan []*protosigverifierservice.Response
    verifier       *verifier
    config         *ExecutorConfig
}
```

It provides the following methods:
- `newParallelExecutor(config *ExecutorConfig) *parallelExecutor`: Creates a new executor instance.
- `handleChannelInput(ctx context.Context)`: Processes input requests. Runs in parallel from multiple goroutines.
- `handleCutoff(ctx context.Context)`: Manages response batching.

#### Policy Management

The policy package (under `policy/...`) provides functions for policy management:
- `ParseNamespacePolicyItem(pd *protoblocktx.PolicyItem) (*signature.NsVerifier, error)`: Parses namespace policies.
- `ParsePolicyFromConfigTx(value []byte) (*signature.NsVerifier, error)`: Parses policies from config transactions.
- `GetUpdatesFromNamespace(nsTx *protoblocktx.TxNamespace) *protosigverifierservice.Update`: Extracts policy updates from namespace transactions.
- `ValidateNamespaceID(nsID string) error`: Validates namespace IDs.

### Transaction Flow

Transactions are received in batches over a bidirectional gRPC stream.
The verifier processes each transaction and sends responses back through the same stream.
The order of transactions in the response is not guaranteed to match the order of the incoming requests.

Each received transaction is added to an internal queue.
Multiple worker routines consume from this queue to perform validation and place the results into an output queue.
A separate batching worker collects validated responses from the output queue and groups them into batches.
These batches are then placed in a response queue.
Finally, a dedicated sender worker reads from the response queue and transmits the response batches over the gRPC stream.

Following is a detailed description of this flow.

#### Stream Initialization

The `StartStream` method initializes a bidirectional gRPC stream for verification.
It starts the following workers, and stops if one of them fails.

#### Request Handling

The `handleInputs` method processes incoming verification requests.
Policy updates are piggybacked over received batches, and applied before inserting the transactions to the queue.
Full description of the policy management will follow.

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/verifier_server.go](/service/verifier/verifier_server.go).
```go
func (s *Server) handleInputs(
    ctx context.Context,
    stream protosigverifierservice.Verifier_StartStreamServer,
    executor *parallelExecutor,
) error {
    input := channel.NewWriter(ctx, executor.inputCh)
    for {
        batch, rpcErr := stream.Recv()
        if rpcErr != nil { ... }
        
        // Update policies if included in the batch.
        err := executor.verifier.updatePolicies(batch.Update)
        if err != nil { ... }
        
        // Pass verification requests for processing.
        for _, r := range batch.Requests {
            if ok := input.Write(r); !ok { ... }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Response Handling

The `handleOutputs` method processes verification responses:

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/verifier_server.go](/service/verifier/verifier_server.go).
```go
func (s *Server) handleOutputs(
    ctx context.Context,
    stream protosigverifierservice.Verifier_StartStreamServer,
    executor *parallelExecutor,
) error {
    output := channel.NewReader(ctx, executor.outputCh)
    for {
        outputs, ok := output.Read()
        if !ok {
            return errors.Wrap(stream.Context().Err(), "context ended")
        }
        
        // Update metrics and send responses
        promutil.AddToCounter(s.metrics.VerifierServerOutTxs, len(outputs))
        promutil.AddToGauge(s.metrics.ActiveRequests, -len(outputs))
        rpcErr := stream.Send(&protosigverifierservice.ResponseBatch{Responses: outputs})
        if rpcErr != nil {
            return errors.Wrap(rpcErr, "stream ended")
        }
    }
}
```


#### Batching

The `handleCutoff` method implements response batching:

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/parallel_executor.go](/service/verifier/parallel_executor.go).
```go
func (e *parallelExecutor) handleCutoff(ctx context.Context) {
    var outputBuffer []*protosigverifierservice.Response
    chOut := channel.NewWriter(ctx, e.outputCh)
    
    cutBatch := func(size int) {
        for len(outputBuffer) >= size {
            batchSize := min(e.config.BatchSizeCutoff, len(outputBuffer))
            chOut.Write(outputBuffer[:batchSize])
            outputBuffer = outputBuffer[batchSize:]
        }
    }
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return
        case <-time.After(e.config.BatchTimeCutoff):
            // Time-based batching
            cutBatch(1)
        case output := <-e.outputSingleCh:
            // Size-based batching
            outputBuffer = append(outputBuffer, output)
            cutBatch(e.config.BatchSizeCutoff)
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation balances throughput and latency by using both size-based and time-based batching.

#### Worker Pool

The service uses a fixed-size worker pool for parallel processing:

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/parallel_executor.go](/service/verifier/parallel_executor.go).
```go
for range executor.config.Parallelism {
    g.Go(func() error {
        executor.handleChannelInput(gCtx)
        return gCtx.Err()
    })
}
```

Each worker processes requests independently.

### Policy Management

#### Policy Storage

Policies are stored in an atomic map to allow lock-free updates:

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/verify.go](/service/verifier/verify.go).
```go
type verifier struct {
    verifiers atomic.Pointer[map[string]*signature.NsVerifier]
}
```

This design allows concurrent reads while supporting atomic updates.

#### Policy Updates

The `updatePolicies` method handles policy updates.
It may return error if it fails to parse the policy. This should never happen in a correct node because malformed
policies are rejected beforehand. Thus, such error should fail the node.

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/verify.go](/service/verifier/verify.go).
```go
func (v *verifier) updatePolicies(
    update *protosigverifierservice.Update,
) error {
    if update == nil || (update.Config == nil && update.NamespacePolicies == nil) {
        return nil
    }
    
    // Parse new policies
    newVerifiers, err := parsePolicies(update)
    if err != nil {
        return errors.Join(ErrUpdatePolicies, err)
    }

    // Merge with existing policies
    for k, nsVerifier := range *v.verifiers.Load() {
        if _, ok := newVerifiers[k]; !ok {
            newVerifiers[k] = nsVerifier
        }
    }
    
    // Atomically update the policy map
    v.verifiers.Store(&newVerifiers)
    return nil
}
```

#### Policy Parsing

Policies can be derived from a config block (meta namespace policy), or from a namespace update (namespace policy).

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/verify.go](/service/verifier/verify.go).
```go
func parsePolicies(update *protosigverifierservice.Update) (map[string]*signature.NsVerifier, error) {
    newPolicies := make(map[string]*signature.NsVerifier)
    
    // Parse config transaction policies
    if update.Config != nil {
        nsVerifier, err := policy.ParsePolicyFromConfigTx(update.Config.Envelope)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, errors.Join(ErrUpdatePolicies, err)
        }
        newPolicies[types.MetaNamespaceID] = nsVerifier
    }
    
    // Parse namespace policies
    if update.NamespacePolicies != nil {
        for _, pd := range update.NamespacePolicies.Policies {
            nsVerifier, err := policy.ParseNamespacePolicyItem(pd)
            if err != nil {
                return nil, errors.Join(ErrUpdatePolicies, err)
            }
            newPolicies[pd.Namespace] = nsVerifier
        }
    }
    return newPolicies, nil
}
```

### Verification Logic

The `verifyRequest` method verifies a transaction against namespace policies.

From [fabric-x-committer/service/verifier/verify.go](/service/verifier/verify.go).
```go
func (v *verifier) verifyRequest(request *protosigverifierservice.Request) *protosigverifierservice.Response {
    return &protosigverifierservice.Response{
        TxId:     request.Tx.Id,
        BlockNum: request.BlockNum,
        TxNum:    request.TxNum,
        Status:   protoblocktx.Status_COMMITTED,
    }
    // The verifiers might temporarily retain the old map while updatePolicies has already set a new one.
    // This is acceptable, provided the coordinator sends the validation status to the dependency graph
    // after updating the policies in the verifier.
    // This ensures that dependent data transactions on these updated namespaces always use the map
    // containing the latest policy.
    verifiers := *v.verifiers.Load()
    for nsIndex, ns := range request.Tx.Namespaces {
        if ns.NsId == types.ConfigNamespaceID {
            // Configuration TX is not signed in the same manner as application TX.
            // Its signatures are verified by the ordering service.
            continue
        }
        nsVerifier, ok := verifiers[ns.NsId]
        if !ok {
            logger.Debugf("No verifier for namespace: '%v'", ns.NsId)
            response.Status = protoblocktx.Status_ABORTED_SIGNATURE_INVALID
            return response
        }

        // NOTE: We do not compare the namespace version in the transaction
        //       against the namespace version in the verifier. This is because if
        //       the versions mismatch, and we reject the transaction, the coordinator
        //       would mark the transaction as invalid due to a bad signature. However,
        //       this may not be true if the policy was not actually updated with the
        //       new version. Hence, we should proceed to validate the signatures. If
        //       the signatures are valid, the validator-committer service would
        //       still mark the transaction as invalid due to an MVCC conflict on the
        //       namespace version, which would reflect the correct validation status.
        if err := nsVerifier.VerifyNs(request.Tx, nsIndex); err != nil {
            logger.Debugf("Invalid signature found: '%v', namespace id: '%v'", request.Tx.Id, ns.NsId)
            response.Status = protoblocktx.Status_ABORTED_SIGNATURE_INVALID
            return response
        }
    }
    return response
}
```

The `VerifyNs()` method in the `signature.NsVerifier` verifies signatures for a specific namespace:

1. It extracts the signatures for the namespace from the transaction.
2. It verifies each signature against the namespace policy.
3. It returns an error if any signature is invalid.
