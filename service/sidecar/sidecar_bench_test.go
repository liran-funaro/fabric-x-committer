// BenchmarkSidecarEndToEnd measures the sidecar as a whole service, at the block sizes a
// deployment realistically chooses between. Every stage the sidecar owns is in the measurement: a
// block is pulled over the orderer's Deliver stream and its consenter signatures verified, mapped
// into a coordinator batch (envelope parsing, form validation, TX ID dedup), submitted to the
// coordinator over a real gRPC stream, its statuses collected as they come back out of order, and
// the block appended to a real on-disk ledger with its status metadata attached.
//
// Only the two peers are stubbed, because both live on other machines in a deployment and would
// otherwise be measured alongside the sidecar on this one:
//   - The orderer serves blocks that were built and signed before the timer started, so delivery
//     costs a cache read and a gRPC write. See mock.Orderer.SubmitPreparedBlock for why block
//     preparation cannot stay on that path at these rates.
//   - The coordinator is benchCoordinator, which echoes COMMITTED without validating anything.
//
// b.N counts transactions, so ns/op and tx/s stay per transaction however the block size changes.
// The benchmark holds every generated transaction in memory before it starts — roughly 700 bytes
// each — so drive it with an explicit count (`-benchtime 2000000x`) rather than a duration, which
// would let the transaction pool grow until the machine swaps.
